# Galaxy Clustering in 3D space

This projects involve a clustering analysis, on the [HECATE](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.506.1896K/abstract) galaxy catalog 
based on the galaxies spatial arrangement, with the intention of assigning cluster identifiers to each galaxy candidate. The project builds upon the
Master's Thesis titled ["Galaxy cluster detection in the local universe, using machine learning methods"](https://elocus.lib.uoc.gr//dlib/e/1/5/metadata-dlib-1698042506-220193-30897.tkl).
The proposed methods include the use of DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering and a combination (stacking) of these two clustering algorithms. 

## Data

[HECATE (The Heraklion Extragalactic CATaloguE) (K. Kovlakas, A. Zezas, J. Andrews
et al. 2021)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.506.1896K/abstract) is an all-sky value-added galaxy catalog of
204,733 individual galaxies within a radius of 200 Mpc (Redshift/z=0.05). HECATE is based on the HyperLEDA catalog and is enriched with additional information from other extragalactic and photometric catalogues. The catalog aims to
support contemporary and upcoming multi-wavelength investigations of the nearby universe. It offers lots of information such as positions, distances, sizes, photometric measurements etc., but not cluster associations.

In order to develop and test the methods presented in this project, local universe galactic catalogs of known clusters were also used, like:

* [Northern/Southern Abell catalogue (G. Abell, H. Corwin et al. 1989)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1989ApJS...70....1A/abstract)
* [Compact Groups of Galaxies (A. McConnachie, D. Patton et al. 2009)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009MNRAS.395..255M/abstract)
* [Hickson Compact Groups of Galaxies (P. Hickson 1982)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1982ApJ...255..382H/abstract)
* [Extended Virgo Cluster Catalog (K. Suk, R. Soo-Chang et al. 2014)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJS..215...22K/abstract)
* Abell catalog, a complete search was performed on [NED (NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database)](https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/) with ’ABELL’ cross-ID
