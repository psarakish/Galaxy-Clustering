# Galaxy Clustering in 3D space

This projects implements machine learning applications, such as clustering algorithms, on the [HECATE](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.506.1896K/abstract) 
(The Heraklion Extragalactic CATaloguE) galaxy catalog, an all-sky value-added galaxy catalogue of 204,733 individual galaxies within a radius of 200 Mpc. The project builds upon the
Master's Thesis titled ["Galaxy cluster detection in the local universe, using machine learning methods"](https://elocus.lib.uoc.gr//dlib/e/1/5/metadata-dlib-1698042506-220193-30897.tkl).
The proposed methods involve the use of DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering and a combination (stacking) of these two algorithms.
